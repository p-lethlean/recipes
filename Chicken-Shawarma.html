    <p>This Chicken Shawarma recipe is going to knock your socks off! Just a handful of every day spices makes an
        incredible Chicken Shawarma marinade that infuses the chicken with exotic Middle Eastern flavours. The smell
        when this is cooking is insane!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
        <li>Cardamon</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Cayenne</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix marinade – For convenience, just mix the marinade directly in a ziplock bag. A bag works best because
            the
            chicken remains nicely coated in the marinade. If you prefer to use a container, either turn the chicken a
            few
            times or increase the marinade by 50%.</li>

        <li>Add chicken into the marinade. Seal the bag, removing excess air, then massage to coat from the outside.
            Leave
            to marinade for 12 to 24 hours in the fridge. If you’re pressed for time, even 3 hours will do!</li>

        <li>Yogurt sauce – Make the yogurt sauce simply by mixing the ingredients then set aside for at least 20 minutes
            to
            let the flavours meld. This will keep for 3 days in the fridge.</li>

        <li>Cook chicken either on the stove or on the BBQ. It will get a great crust on it from the spices, and you
            will
            adore the smell. It’s intoxicating!</li>

        <li>Rest chicken for at least 3 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the flesh,
            else they will just run out everywhere when you slice the meat.</li>

        <li>To serve, just pile everything on a platter and let everybody make their own wraps! The chicken, lettuce,
            tomato
            slices, onion, yogurt sauce and warmed flatbreads – homemade or store bought. If the chicken is on the
            larger
            side, I sometimes slice it. But if they are smaller, I tend to just leave them whole.</li>
